# AI Center at MDC North

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the AI Center at MDC North. This repository serves as the central hub for all AI-related projects spearheaded by our team. Our inaugural project involves enhancing our AI System Skyy by integrating it with transformer-based Large Language Models (LLM) to leverage capabilities such as memory access, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and Semantic Caching.

## Project Overview

### System Skyy Integration

The current project aims to connect our proprietary AI System Skyy to a state-of-the-art LLM. This integration is intended to enhance Skyy's functionalities with the latest advancements in AI research, including:

- **Memory Systems**: Enhance Skyy with the ability to access and retrieve information from a structured memory system.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation**: Utilize RAG for dynamic data retrieval, improving the model's response accuracy and relevance.
- **Semantic Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to speed up response times and reduce computational overhead.

### Research and Development

Our research focuses on the following areas:
- **Cognitive Architecture**: Developing agents with the capability to create and evolve within digital environments.
- **Vector and Embedding Research**: Exploring embedding techniques for efficient vector storage and cosine similarity applications.
- **Safety and Bias Mitigation**: Ensuring that all AI models are safe and unbiased.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Developing tools and methodologies to evaluate AI model performance reliably.

### System Requirements

- **Local Model Deployment**: Identify and deploy models capable of running efficiently on local systems.
- **Embedding Generation**: Utilize models that can create meaningful and contextually relevant embeddings.
- **Text to Speech**: Implement systems that convert text into speech quickly and accurately.
- **Data Scraping**: Automate data collection from the MDC website to enhance our dataset.
- **Query Tracking**: Develop mechanisms to log and analyze user queries to continuously improve model responses.
